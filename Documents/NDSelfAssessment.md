# Nolan Daly Self-Assessment

Going into this project, I was not entirely sure which direction we were going to take. Since it was just the two of us, we decided not to do anyting overly ambitious, but still wanted to create something that would be challenging and push us to use as much of our knowledge as possible. From out of our potential ideas, we decided on Emma's "to-be-read booklist generator" project, with me taking the front-end of the programming and Emma taking the back-end. However, while Emma had prior experience in both front- and back-end programming for web applications, I had no such experience with either. This led to our initial timelines and plans being far more optimistic than what I was actually able to accomplish, as the vast majority of my time working on this project has been focusing on learning the required platforms and completing assignments for the course.
