# Project Description
Our project is focused on creating an interactive, web-based application that is capable of generating a list of potential books to read based on user criteria. The application will be split into two main parts: a front-end for user interaction and output, and a back-end for processing queries and interacting with our database. The front-end will allow the user to specify some criteria for filtering results, which will then be used by the back-end to generate a list from the database. This list will then be sent to the front-end of the application and displayed to the user.
